I am an Applied Research Scientist at the [AllSci Corp](https://allsci.com/) working on AI4Science objectives. My research interests lie in the intersection of Large Language models, Representational Learning, Information Theory, Science of Science, and Uncertainty Quantification. In the past, I was a research scientist at the [Center for Science of Science and Innovation](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/science-of-science.aspx) working for [Dashun Wang](https://www.dashunwang.com/) at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.

Previously, I was a Ph.D student advised by [Dr. Hamed Alhoori](https://alhoori.github.io/), and my dissertation fully funded by the [NSF grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2022443&HistoricalAwards=false). focussed on building a predictive modeling framework to investigate the [*Reproducibility crisis in AI*](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.359.6377.725?casa_token=B4RgaLsweT0AAAAA%3AsuAiGo_9E7o0T0WkRQPxEQVn3-X9edRZ8OatwAxM2YEifI-S2bGXYNtTwNdRDg38zqEVTqBhLYe1SfE). Previously, I was a [Givens Research Associate](https://www.anl.gov/education/givens-associates) and an [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility Graduate Student researcher](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/alcf-student-opportunities). I have given a workshop on using AutoML for Graph Neural Architecture Search, available at [ALCF DeepHyper Automated Machine Learning Workshop](https://deephyper.github.io/events/workshop-anl-2022-summer).

I am an Open Source Enthusiast and in the past I had the opportunity to represent `mozilla` and `webcompat` communities. I enjoy capturing random objects, candid moments and vivid terrains. I am [peredepain](https://www.instagram.com/peredepain/) on Instagram. I'm available for email at `akhilpandey095@gmail.com` (no spam please :D )

In my previous life, [Mozilla Official Contributor](https://www.mozilla.org/credits/), Speaker [FOSSASIA 2016, Singapore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUoCGXDjvvQ), and Google Summer of Code Student.
