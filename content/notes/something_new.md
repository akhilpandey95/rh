### Context
Sustaining the habit of writing is incredibly hard and something I've recognized is quite challenging to sustain.
I really like looking at my notes and keeping my mechanical part of my brain active to ensure my recall capacity
is fully functional. Although it seems pointless to other, I've always considered my daily notes as a great source
of comfort because I know there is one place I can reliably go and fetch information that I've come across when
I'm tinkering something random. That said, why do this publicly, well after observing a lot of people give me
raised eyebrows when they look at my obsidian notes coupled with the fact that I've been recommended to have my
notes made public, I gave into the idea that there is some public utility to my notes. But I guess more importantly,
there is greater benefit for me to fetch important information when needed/required immediately (+1 if its on the web).

### Be kind to yourself and your ideas
Writing and reading are intertwined with one another and any person who just likes one, without seeing and reciprocating
the other is selfish to some degree. Also, I've always waited for a perfect opportunity to release my blogs because part
of me always was fascinated reading blogs from [Lilian](https://lilianweng.github.io/), [Chris Olah](https://colah.github.io/),
and last but not least [Gwern](https://gwern.net/). And if you know something about these people, you do realize they have
an elevated sense of taste, opinion, presentation of material that makes it so satisfying to read. Equally, you know you
are reading some quality material.

But everyone is different i guess, so I personally felt I shouldn't stop myself from documenting moments of honest 
reflection, learning, knowledge sharing from my personal journey just because they aren't complete or polished. I know
it is a classic case of mimicking ideal behaviour, but I honestly grew out of this facade. To that extent, as much as this
statement is for myself, it is also to you to rememember to be kind to yourself, your ideas and publish that damn blog.

> I don't like living on the edge, but disabling spell check and grammar checks and writing this in vim/obsidian is giving
me tingly sensations.

### Labeling matters; sometimes
The meta connection between a [$\textit{label}$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label) and its perceived meaning plays
a dominant role in how we give stimulus. Considering these writings/scribes as $\textit{notes}$ made me rewire or reconsider the
effort I would potentially put in to write and push the material out compare to $\textit{blogs}$. So, labeling matters I guess,
or at the very least it is a compelling enough reason for me to write more often.

> I sometimes wonder if being verbose is a feature/bug of spending more time in school.

### Introducing "notes"
Well, if you've skipped the above part and want a TLDR version of this page, this section is your friend. I plan to push
a personal conversational style written vlogs that are messy, dense, all over the place compared to the perfect blogs because
these "notes" allow me to incrementally explore the progression of an idea over a set of topics that are personally fascinating
to me when it comes to science, math, and programming. So, say hi to [notes](../)

> I `rm -rf blog/*`, so you're never going to find them anytime soon. :)
